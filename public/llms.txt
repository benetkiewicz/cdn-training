	- Key concepts: Terraform, IaC, versioned deployments.

## Quick glossary (1-liners)
- CDN: Distributed network serving content closer to users for latency and resilience.
- POP: Point of Presence (edge server location) that caches and serves content.
- Origin: Your application/server of record behind the CDN.
- Cache key: Identifier for a cached object (commonly host+path+query).
- Normalization: Reducing cache key variety by ignoring/transforming inputs (e.g., UTMs).
- Vary: Header indicating alternate variants of a response (e.g., by Accept-Language).
- TTL: Time to live for a cached object.
- VCL: Fastly’s DSL to customize request/response handling at the edge.
- Surrogate-Control: Header controlling shared caches (preferred by Fastly over Cache-Control).
- ACL: Access control list for IPs.
- Edge Dictionary: Key-value store replicated across POPs for flags/config.

## Access model
- Public lessons are directly accessible.
- Premium lessons require sign-in; unauthenticated users are redirected to /premium.
