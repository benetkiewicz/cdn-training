            <h2>1. Introduction to CDNs</h2>

            <p>
                Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) are a crucial part of modern web infrastructure. They are
                geographically distrubuted servers, which are physically and logically closer to the end user,
                delivering web content faster and more efficiently. See the below diagram for a visual representation of
                how CDNs work.
            </p>

            <div class="image-wrapper">
                <img src={cdnDiagram.src} alt="CDN Diagram" />
            </div>

            <p>
                The idea is that each client worldwide, instead of fetching content from one, centralized server across
                the world, can fetch content from a server that is closer to them. This reduces latency and improves the
                overall performance of the website.
            </p>
            <p>
                The process of determining which server is nearest and contains the requested content relies on
                protocols that govern the internet. Various CDN providers primarily use Anycast Routing or GeoDNS, both
                of which are integrated into the DNS protocol.
            </p>
            <p>
                The servers spread across the world are <em>Edge servers</em> or <em>POPs (Points of Presence)</em>. The
                server that actually server the content is called a <em>Origin Server</em>. Each POP contains a cached
                copy of the content.
            </p>
            <p>
                In some more advanced scenarios, one of the POPs has a special role of being a Shield server. Shield
                usually stands close to the origin server and is used as a kind of proxy to distribute content to the
                rest of the POPs network. Since the Shield is the only POP fetching content from the origin, it
                essentially shields the origin from the flood or requests coming from all POPs in the network.
            </p>
            <p>
                The content is cached in the POPs for a certain period of time, after which it is deleted to make space
                for new content. The length of the caching time, the parts of the content that should be cached and
                strategies for caching can be configured in many ways via the UI, HTTP headers being sent by origin or
                special scripting (such as VCL in Varnish) deployed as part of CDN configuration.
